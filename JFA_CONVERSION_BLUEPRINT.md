# JFA Power Diagram (Weighted Voronoi) Conversion Blueprint

**Project:** Fabric of Space - Custom Taichi Grid  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 (Revised with high-impact refinements)  
**Goal:** Replace distance-based neighbor counting with topologically-stable Power Diagram Face-Sharing Count (FSC)

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to replace the current spatial hashing grid neighbor detection system with a **Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) based 3D Power Diagram** (weighted Voronoi) tessellation approach. This change addresses fundamental limitations in the distance-based contact model when particle sizes change dynamically.

**Key Revision (v2.0):** We use **Power diagram** (Laguerre-Voronoi) instead of standard Voronoi to properly account for particle size. The distance metric becomes `d² - r²` where `r` is particle radius, making cell boundaries reflect actual particle surfaces rather than just centers.

---

## 1. Current System Overview

### 1.1 Current Neighbor Detection Method

**Approach:** Spatial hashing grid with distance-based contact detection

**Key Components:**
- `grid.py`: Spatial hash grid with CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) storage
- `count_neighbors()` kernel: Checks 27-343 neighboring cells based on dynamic reach
- **Contact criterion:** `distance(i, j) < r_i + r_j + CONTACT_TOL`

**Parameters:**
```python
CELL_SIZE = 0.008120  # Grid cell size
CONTACT_TOL = 0.015   # Contact tolerance margin
reach = ceil(r_cut / CELL_SIZE)  # Dynamic stencil reach
```

### 1.2 Current Limitations

**Problem 1: "Sinkhole" Effect**
- When particles shrink, they lose distance-based contacts
- Can become isolated even in dense packing
- Adjustment pressure cannot reach orphaned particles

**Problem 2: "Gap" Effect**
- When particles grow, they push neighbors away
- Creates unfillable voids between particles
- No mechanism to recruit new neighbors into gaps

**Problem 3: Temporal Instability**
- Neighbor relationships flicker as particles grow/shrink
- Distance threshold creates sharp contact boundaries
- Makes topology tracking unreliable

**Root Cause:** Distance-based contacts are *geometric* (rigid thresholds) rather than *topological* (space partitioning).

## 2. Proposed JFA-Voronoi System

### 2.1 Core Concept

**New Approach:** **Power Diagram** (weighted Voronoi) tessellation with Face-Sharing Count (FSC)

**Key Principle:** Two particles are neighbors if their Power diagram cells share a face, regardless of distance.

**Power Diagram vs Standard Voronoi:**
- **Standard Voronoi:** Cell boundaries based on `distance(x, particle_i)`
- **Power Diagram:** Cell boundaries based on `distance²(x, particle_i) - radius²(particle_i)`
- **Result:** Larger particles get larger cells, matching physical extent
- **Critical for polydisperse systems:** Prevents small particles from being "swallowed" by large neighbors

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Topologically stable (neighbor relations persist through size changes)
- ✅ No "sinkhole" problem (shrinking particles keep neighbors)
- ✅ No "gap" problem (space is always fully partitioned)
- ✅ Natural handling of polydispersity (cell size ∝ particle size)
- ✅ Physically meaningful: cell boundaries approximate contact surfaces

### 2.2 Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) for Power Diagrams

**What is JFA?**
- Fast parallel algorithm for computing approximate Voronoi/Power diagrams on GPU
- Works on discrete 3D grid (voxel representation)
- Complexity: O(log N) passes, each pass touches all voxels once
- Taichi-friendly: fully parallelizable, no atomic operations needed
- **Adapts to Power diagram:** Use weighted distance `d² - r²` instead of `d`

**JFA Process:**
1. Initialize 3D grid with particle seed positions
2. Propagate nearest-particle-ID in logarithmic jumps using **power distance**
3. Result: Each voxel knows which particle owns it (weighted by size)
4. Extract face-sharing relationships from boundary voxels
5. **Early-exit optimization:** Skip voxels that haven't changed in 2+ passes

### 2.3 Face-Sharing Count (FSC)

**Definition:** For particle `i`, FSC = number of distinct particles whose Power diagram cells share a face with cell `i`.

**Computation:**
1. For each voxel in the JFA grid
2. Check 6 face-neighbors (±x, ±y, ±z)
3. If neighbor voxel belongs to different particle → face-sharing detected
4. Accumulate unique neighbor IDs per particle using **bounded adjacency list**

**Bounded Adjacency Storage:**
```python
MAX_NEIGHBORS = 32  # Upper bound for neighbor list
neighbor_list = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=(MAX_PARTICLES, MAX_NEIGHBORS))
neighbor_count = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=MAX_PARTICLES)
```
- **Rationale:** Avoids dynamic memory allocation in Taichi
- **Overflow handling:** If `neighbor_count[i] >= MAX_NEIGHBORS`, log warning but cap at MAX_NEIGHBORS
- **Typical values:** Even in dense 3D packing, FSC rarely exceeds 20

**Expected FSC Values for 3D:**
- **FCC packing (ideal):** FSC = 12 (each sphere touches 12 neighbors)
- **Random close packing:** FSC = 14 ± 2 (typical range: 12-16)
- **Loose packing:** FSC = 6-10
- **Target bands for adjustment:**
  - `FSC_LOW = 10`: Trigger growth (underpacked)
  - `FSC_MID = 14`: Target equilibrium
  - `FSC_HIGH = 18`: Trigger shrink (overpacked)

**Relation to Current Degree:**
- Current: `degree[i]` = count of particles within distance threshold
- Proposed: `fsc[i]` = count of particles sharing Power diagram face
- Expected correlation: High (both measure local packing), but FSC is topologically stable
- **Key difference:** FSC weights by particle size, degree does not

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Phase 1: Add JFA Infrastructure (No Disruption)

**Objective:** Implement JFA alongside existing grid system for validation

**New Files to Create:**

#### `jfa.py` - Jump Flood Algorithm Module
```python
# Core JFA kernels
@ti.kernel
def jfa_init(particles_pos, particles_rad, active_n, jfa_grid, jfa_res)
    """Seed JFA grid with particle centers using power distance"""

@ti.kernel  
def jfa_step(jfa_grid, jfa_res, step_size, particles_pos, particles_rad, changed_voxels)
    """Single JFA propagation step (jump by step_size) with early-exit"""

@ti.kernel
def compute_fsc(jfa_grid, jfa_res, neighbor_list, neighbor_count, active_n)
    """Extract face-sharing counts into bounded adjacency lists"""

# Helper functions
def run_jfa(pos, rad, active_n, jfa_res) -> (neighbor_list, neighbor_count)
    """Execute full JFA pipeline, return bounded neighbor lists"""
```

**Key Parameters (Dynamic Resolution):**
```python
# Dynamic resolution based on particle density
def compute_jfa_res(active_n, domain_size, r_mean):
    """
    Choose JFA resolution to ensure ~2-3 voxels per particle diameter.
    
    Target: voxel_size ≈ 0.3 * r_mean (captures features at ~3x resolution)
    """
    target_voxel_size = 0.3 * r_mean
    jfa_res = int(domain_size / target_voxel_size)
    
    # Clamp to reasonable range
    jfa_res = max(64, min(jfa_res, 256))
    
    # Round to power of 2 for efficiency
    jfa_res = 2 ** int(np.log2(jfa_res))
    
    return jfa_res

JFA_RES = compute_jfa_res(active_n, L, r_mean)  # Recompute when r_mean changes significantly
JFA_VOXEL_SIZE = L / JFA_RES
JFA_NUM_PASSES = ceil(log2(JFA_RES))  # ~6-8 passes typically
```

**Data Structures:**
```python
# JFA grid: each voxel stores nearest particle ID
jfa_grid = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=(JFA_RES, JFA_RES, JFA_RES))

# Change tracking for early-exit (ping-pong buffers)
jfa_temp = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=(JFA_RES, JFA_RES, JFA_RES))
changed_voxels = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=(JFA_RES, JFA_RES, JFA_RES))

# Bounded neighbor lists (replaces simple FSC count)
MAX_NEIGHBORS = 32
neighbor_list = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=(MAX_PARTICLES, MAX_NEIGHBORS))
neighbor_count = ti.field(dtype=ti.i32, shape=MAX_PARTICLES)
```

#### Integration Points in `run.py`

**Option A: Parallel Validation (Recommended for Phase 1)**
```python
# Every measurement frame
if adjustment_timer[None] <= 0:
    # Existing distance-based degree
    count_neighbors(pos, rad, deg, ...)
    
    # NEW: JFA-based FSC (run in parallel)
    fsc_values = run_jfa(pos, rad, active_n, JFA_RES)
    
    # Comparison telemetry
    deg_mean = np.mean(deg.to_numpy()[:active_n])
    fsc_mean = np.mean(fsc_values.to_numpy()[:active_n])
    correlation = np.corrcoef(deg, fsc)[0,1]
    
    print(f"[Validation] Degree: μ={deg_mean:.2f}, FSC: μ={fsc_mean:.2f}, corr={correlation:.3f}")
```

**Option B: Direct Replacement (Phase 2)**
```python
# Replace count_neighbors() call with run_jfa()
fsc = run_jfa(pos, rad, active_n, JFA_RES)
# Use fsc instead of deg for growth/shrink decisions
```

### 3.2 Phase 2: Validation and Tuning

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Correlation Test**
   - Run both systems in parallel for 1000+ frames
   - Measure Pearson correlation between `deg` and `fsc`
   - Expected: r > 0.85 (strong correlation)
   - If lower: investigate resolution or boundary effects

2. **Stability Test**
   - Freeze simulation (no PBD/jitter)
   - Let particles grow/shrink only
   - Track `fsc` vs `deg` over time
   - Expected: FSC more stable (less temporal fluctuation)

3. **Sinkhole Detection**
   - Identify particles with `deg=0` (distance-based orphans)
   - Check their `fsc` values
   - Expected: `fsc > 0` (Voronoi keeps them connected)

4. **Performance Benchmark**
   - Measure frame time before/after JFA
   - Current grid: ~0.0005s/frame
   - Target JFA: <0.002s/frame (4x budget)
   - If slower: reduce JFA_RES or run less frequently

**Tuning Parameters:**

| Parameter | Initial | Range | Impact |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| `JFA_RES` | 128 | 64-256 | Accuracy vs speed |
| `JFA_FREQUENCY` | Every frame | 1-5 frames | Amortize cost |
| `VOXEL_MARGIN` | 1.0 | 0.8-1.2 | Capture small features |

### 3.3 Phase 3: Feature Parity

**Replicate Current Features with FSC:**

1. **Color Visualization**
   ```python
   # Replace degree-based colors
   update_colors_by_fsc(col, fsc, active_n, 
                        fsc_low, fsc_mid, fsc_high)
   ```

2. **Adaptive Growth Logic**
   ```python
   # Replace degree thresholds
   if fsc[i] < FSC_LOW_THRESHOLD:
       action[i] = GROW
   elif fsc[i] > FSC_HIGH_THRESHOLD:
       action[i] = SHRINK
   ```

3. **Telemetry Updates**
   ```python
   fsc_mean = compute_mean_fsc(fsc, active_n)
   fsc_min = fsc_min_reduce()
   fsc_max = fsc_max_reduce()
   print(f"FSC: μ={fsc_mean:.2f} [{fsc_min},{fsc_max}]")
   ```

### 3.4 Phase 4: Cleanup and Optimization

**Remove Old System:**
- Delete distance-based `count_neighbors()` (keep for fallback initially)
- Remove `CONTACT_TOL` parameter
- Simplify grid rebuild (only needed for PBD, not topology)

**Optimizations:**
- Cache JFA grid between frames (only update near changed particles)
- Use sparse JFA (skip empty regions)
- Multi-resolution JFA (coarse global + fine local)

### 4.2 Memory Requirements

**Current System:**
```
Grid: 6³ cells × (CSR pointers + indices) ≈ 5 KB
Degree: 10K particles × 4 bytes = 40 KB
Total: ~45 KB
```

**JFA System:**
```
JFA Grid: 128³ voxels × 4 bytes = 8 MB
FSC: 10K particles × 4 bytes = 40 KB  
Temp buffers: 8 MB (ping-pong)
Total: ~16 MB
```

**Impact:** 350× memory increase, but still tiny on modern GPUs (typical 8+ GB VRAM).

### 4.3 Performance Estimates

**JFA Time Complexity:**
- Initialization: O(N) = 10K particles → ~0.0001s
- Propagation: O(log R × R³) = 7 passes × 128³ → ~0.0015s
- FSC extraction: O(R³) = 128³ → ~0.0003s
- **Total: ~0.002s per frame** (vs 0.0005s current grid)

**Optimization Potential:**
- Skip-propagation (early termination): ~30% speedup
- Sparse grid (only occupied regions): 2-3× speedup
- Multi-res (coarse→fine): 2× speedup
- **Optimized target: <0.001s** (competitive with current)

---

## 5. Migration Strategy

### 5.1 Backward Compatibility

**Keep Both Systems During Transition:**

```python
# config.py
USE_JFA_TOPOLOGY = False  # Feature flag
JFA_RES = 128
JFA_VALIDATION_MODE = True  # Run both, compare results
```

**Gradual Rollout:**
1. Week 1: Implement JFA, validation mode only
2. Week 2: Tune parameters, verify correlation
3. Week 3: Switch to JFA, keep distance-based as fallback
4. Week 4: Remove old system if stable

### 5.2 Rollback Plan

**If JFA Issues Arise:**
- Set `USE_JFA_TOPOLOGY = False`
- Revert to distance-based neighbor counting
- Investigate JFA bugs offline

**Known Risks:**
- JFA may miss thin/small features at low resolution
- Periodic boundaries require careful wrapping
- FSC might differ from degree in edge cases

---

## 6. Expected Outcomes

### 6.1 Benefits

**Topological Stability:**
- ✅ Particles maintain neighbors through size changes
- ✅ No more "sinkhole" orphans
- ✅ Growth pressure propagates consistently

**Scientific Validity:**
- ✅ True Voronoi tessellation (mathematically rigorous)
- ✅ Degree counts reflect actual space partitioning
- ✅ Better matches foam/packing literature expectations

**Simulation Quality:**
- ✅ More predictable adjustment dynamics
- ✅ Cleaner size distribution evolution
- ✅ Fewer "stuck" states

### 6.2 Trade-offs

**Computational Cost:**
- Current: 0.0005s/frame for topology
- JFA: ~0.002s/frame (4× slower)
- Still <5% of total frame time (PBD dominates)

**Memory Usage:**
- Current: 45 KB
- JFA: 16 MB (350× increase)
- Negligible on modern hardware

**Complexity:**
- New subsystem to maintain
- More parameters to tune
- Potential for new edge-case bugs

---

## 7. Success Metrics

### 7.1 Validation Criteria (Phase 1 - Revised)

**Must Pass (Core Functionality):**
1. ✅ **Bounded Adjacency Integrity:**
   - Zero overflow warnings (`neighbor_count[i] <= MAX_NEIGHBORS` for all i)
   - Symmetry: If A is neighbor of B, then B is neighbor of A
   - No self-loops: `neighbor_list[i, k] != i` for all i, k
   
2. ✅ **PBC Correctness:**
   - Particles near boundaries detect cross-boundary neighbors
   - No duplicate neighbors in adjacency lists
   - FSC continuous across ±L/2 boundary
   
3. ✅ **Topological Stability:**
   - Freeze test: FSC unchanged when particles don't move
   - Shrink test: FSC ≥ 90% preserved when particle shrinks by 20%
   - No "orphan" particles (FSC=0) in dense regions (ρ > 0.5)
   
4. ✅ **Performance Budget:**
   - Total frame time increase <15% (relaxed from 10% for Phase 1)
   - JFA computation <3ms per frame at 10K particles

**Should Achieve (Quality Metrics):**
1. ✅ **Correlation with distance-based degree:**
   - Pearson: `corr(deg, fsc) > 0.75` (relaxed from 0.80 due to Power weighting)
   - Spearman: `corr_rank(deg, fsc) > 0.85` (better metric for ordinal agreement)
   
2. ✅ **FSC Distribution (3D):**
   - Mean FSC = 14 ± 3 in equilibrium packing
   - <5% of particles with FSC < 8 (under-coordinated)
   - <5% of particles with FSC > 20 (over-coordinated)
   
3. ✅ **Convergence Improvement:**
   - Time to reach steady-state radius distribution: 20% faster
   - Oscillation amplitude (`|grow→shrink|` rate): 30% lower
   
4. ✅ **Visual Quality:**
   - Subjective: "More uniform packing" (no visible voids or clumps)
   - Size polydispersity: CV(radius) stabilizes within 500 frames

### 7.2 Testing Protocol

**Test Suite (Expanded with Additional Validation):**

```python
# tests/test_jfa.py

def test_power_diagram_basic():
    """Verify JFA produces valid Power diagram (not standard Voronoi)"""
    # Setup: 2 particles, different radii (r1=0.01, r2=0.02)
    # Expected: Larger particle gets larger cell (boundary closer to smaller)
    # Verify: Cell boundary at correct power distance
    
def test_fsc_symmetry():
    """If A shares face with B, then B shares with A"""
    # Critical for adjacency list integrity
    
def test_fsc_pbc_modular():
    """Particles near ±L/2 boundary detect wrapped neighbors using strict modular PBC"""
    # Verify: voxel indices wrap correctly with % operator
    # Verify: Power distance accounts for minimum image convention
    
def test_fsc_stability_freeze():
    """FSC unchanged if particles don't move (Phase A1 analog)"""
    # Run JFA twice on identical snapshot, verify identical FSC
    
def test_fsc_stability_shrink():
    """FSC ≥ 90% preserved when particle shrinks by 20%"""
    # Key test for topological stability claim
    
def test_bounded_adjacency_overflow():
    """Verify no crashes/corruption when neighbor_count > MAX_NEIGHBORS"""
    # Setup: Pathological case with >32 neighbors (unlikely but possible)
    # Expected: Graceful capping, telemetry warning
    
def test_dynamic_resolution():
    """Verify JFA_RES adapts correctly to mean radius changes"""
    # Simulate: r_mean doubles → JFA_RES should halve (to maintain voxel_size ≈ 0.3*r_mean)
    # Verify: compute_jfa_res() returns appropriate power-of-2
    
def test_early_exit_correctness():
    """Verify early-exit optimization doesn't break convergence"""
    # Compare: Full JFA (no early-exit) vs early-exit version
    # Expected: Identical FSC output, but faster runtime
    
def test_performance():
    """Benchmark JFA on 10K particles"""
    # Target: <3ms per frame (relaxed Phase 1 budget)
    # Measure: Init, propagation, FSC extraction separately
    
def test_polydispersity():
    """Verify small particles don't get swallowed by large neighbors"""
    # Setup: One r=0.002 particle surrounded by r=0.020 particles
    # Expected: Small particle maintains non-zero FSC (has own cell)
```

## 9. Open Questions

### 9.1 Resolution Choice

**Question:** What JFA_RES provides optimal accuracy/speed tradeoff?

**Options:**
- 64³: Fast but may miss small gaps
- 128³: Balanced (proposed default)
- 256³: High accuracy but 8× cost

**Recommendation:** Start at 128³, profile, then decide.

### 9.2 Update Frequency

**Question:** Must we run JFA every frame?

**Options:**
- Every frame: Most accurate, highest cost
- Every 2-5 frames: Amortize cost, slight lag
- Only on measurement frames: Cheapest, matches current use

**Recommendation:** Start every frame, optimize later if needed.

### 9.3 Handling Degenerate Cases

**Question:** What if two particles are exactly equidistant to a voxel?

**Resolution:** JFA naturally breaks ties by propagation order (deterministic). Accept as-is, or add tie-breaking rule (e.g., prefer lower particle ID).

## 10. Key Refinements in v2.0

**High-Impact Changes from Original Blueprint:**

### 10.1 Power Diagram Instead of Standard Voronoi
**Why:** Standard Voronoi ignores particle size. Power diagram uses weighted distance `d² - r²`, making cell boundaries reflect actual particle surfaces. Critical for polydisperse systems.

**Impact:** Prevents small particles from being "swallowed" by large neighbors. FSC now correlates with physical contact rather than just proximity.

### 10.2 Strict Modular Addressing for PBC
**Why:** Vector modulo (`%`) operator has known bugs in Taichi/Metal backend with negative indices.

**Solution:** Use component-wise modulo: `[(I[0] + offset[0]) % jfa_res, ...]` instead of `(I + offset) % jfa_res`.

**Impact:** Eliminates PBC-related artifacts (missing neighbors, duplicates) at domain boundaries.

### 10.3 Bounded Per-Particle Adjacency Lists
**Why:** Dynamic memory allocation not supported in Taichi kernels. Need to track actual neighbor IDs (not just counts) for future features (e.g., force calculations, topological analysis).

**Solution:** Fixed-size arrays `neighbor_list[MAX_PARTICLES, MAX_NEIGHBORS=32]` with graceful overflow handling.

**Impact:** Enables richer neighbor-based computations beyond just FSC count. Memory overhead: 1.3 MB (10K particles × 32 neighbors × 4 bytes).

### 10.4 Appropriate FSC Bands for 3D
**Why:** Original blueprint used 2D intuition (ESC=6 typical). In 3D, FCC packing has FSC=12, random close packing FSC=14±2.

**Solution:** Adjusted target bands: `FSC_LOW=10, FSC_MID=14, FSC_HIGH=18` to match 3D physics.

**Impact:** Prevents over-packing (old 2D targets would trigger excessive shrinking in 3D).

### 10.5 Dynamic Resolution Tied to Density
**Why:** Fixed `JFA_RES=128` wastes compute when `r_mean` is large, and underresolves when `r_mean` is small.

**Solution:** `JFA_RES = compute_jfa_res(r_mean)` targets `voxel_size ≈ 0.3 * r_mean` (3x oversampling), clamped to [64, 256], rounded to power-of-2.

**Impact:** Balances accuracy and performance as particles grow/shrink. Typical: 128³ initially, adjusts to 64³ or 256³ as needed.

### 10.6 Early-Exit in JFA Passes
**Why:** Standard JFA propagates every voxel every pass, even if most are already converged.

**Solution:** Track `changed_voxels` field. Skip voxels unchanged for 2+ consecutive passes.

**Impact:** 20-30% speedup in propagation phase (empirical estimate from JFA literature).

### 10.7 Enhanced Validation Suite
**Why:** Original success metrics were vague ("correlation > 0.80"). Need concrete, testable criteria.

**Additions:**
- Symmetry test (A→B implies B→A)
- PBC correctness (cross-boundary neighbors)
- Stability tests (freeze, shrink)
- Overflow handling (bounded list)
- Polydispersity test (small/large mixing)

**Impact:** Catches edge-case bugs before deployment. Higher confidence in Phase 1 results.

## 11. Conclusion

**Summary:**

Replacing the distance-based spatial hash grid with a **JFA-based Power Diagram FSC** system addresses fundamental topological instabilities in the current simulation. The v2.0 proposal incorporates critical refinements for polydisperse 3D systems:

- ✅ **Physically accurate:** Power diagram respects particle size
- ✅ **Robust PBC:** Strict modular addressing prevents boundary bugs
- ✅ **Scalable:** Dynamic resolution adapts to particle size
- ✅ **Topologically stable:** Neighbor relations persist through size changes
- ✅ **Well-tested:** Comprehensive validation suite
- ✅ **Low-risk:** Validation-first approach with clear acceptance bar

**Recommendation:** **Proceed with implementation.**

The proposed system is more sophisticated than the original blueprint, but each refinement addresses a specific failure mode identified in the current simulation or anticipated from domain knowledge. The validation-first approach (Phase 1-2) allows us to quantify benefits before committing to full migration.

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Review blueprint with user - Completed with high-impact refinements
2. Get approval on memory/performance budgets (Phase 1: 16 MB, <3ms/frame)
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation of `jfa.py` with Power diagram support
4. Implement comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_jfa.py`)
5. Run validation in parallel with existing grid system
6. Schedule weekly check-ins to track progress
