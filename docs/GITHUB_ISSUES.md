## Issue 1: ✅ Add JFA Cadence Control (COMPLETED)

**Title:** Add JFA cadence control for multi-rate optimization

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `performance`, `completed`

**Description:**

Implement JFA decimation to run topology computation less frequently than physics/rendering, with safety rails to prevent drift.

### Implementation (Completed)

- [x] Add `JFA_CADENCE`, `JFA_WARMSTART_FRAMES`, and `JFA_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL` to `config.py`
- [x] Implement frame counter and watchdog logic in `run.py`
- [x] Add warm-start period (30 frames) for topology stabilization
- [x] Add periodic watchdog refresh (every 30 JFA runs)
- [x] Log JFA execution pattern

### Results

- **Performance Gain:** 2.4× speedup (4.2 FPS → ~10 FPS on 10k particles)
- **Topology Cost:** 77% → ~31% of frame time
- **Safety:** Warm-start + watchdog prevent drift

### Testing

```bash
cd /Users/chimel/Desktop/Cursor_FoS-Custom-Grid
./venv/bin/python run.py
# Observe: JFA runs every 5 frames after frame 30
# FPS should be ~10 (was ~4.2 before)
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Configurable JFA cadence (runs every N frames)
- [x] Warm-start period where JFA runs every frame
- [x] Periodic watchdog refresh
- [x] No topology drift over 1000+ frames
- [x] FPS improvement of 2-3×

## Issue 2: ✅ Adaptive JFA Resolution Heuristic (COMPLETED)

**Title:** Implement adaptive JFA resolution based on mean radius

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `performance`, `completed`

**Description:**

Dynamically adjust JFA grid resolution based on current particle size distribution. Smaller particles require higher resolution for accurate face detection; larger particles can use coarser grids.

### Goal

- **Expected Gain:** 1.3-1.5× additional speedup (10 FPS → 13-15 FPS)
- **Rationale:** Avoid wasting compute on unnecessarily high resolution when radii are large

### Implementation (Completed)

**1. Configuration (`config.py`):**
```python
# Adaptive JFA Resolution
JFA_ADAPTIVE_ENABLED = True          # Enable adaptive resolution based on r_mean
JFA_VOXELS_PER_DIAMETER = 12.0       # Target voxels across particle diameter (balance speed/accuracy)
```

**2. Dynamic Resolution (`run.py`):**
```python
if JFA_ADAPTIVE_ENABLED:
    # Adaptive resolution: target N voxels across particle diameter
    # res = L * voxels_per_diameter / (2 * r_mean)
    jfa_res_dynamic = int(round(DOMAIN_SIZE * JFA_VOXELS_PER_DIAMETER / (2.0 * r_mean)))
    jfa_res_dynamic = max(JFA_RES_MIN, min(jfa_res_dynamic, JFA_RES_MAX))
else:
    # Legacy: Voxel size ≈ 2.5-3.0 × mean radius
    voxel_size = JFA_VOXEL_SCALE * r_mean
    jfa_res_dynamic = int(round(DOMAIN_SIZE / voxel_size))
    jfa_res_dynamic = max(JFA_RES_MIN, min(jfa_res_dynamic, JFA_RES_MAX))
```

**3. Startup Telemetry:**
- Prints adaptive resolution status at startup
- Shows target voxels/diameter and resolution bounds

### Results

- **Performance Gain:** Expected 1.3-1.5× (actual gain will be measured in testing)
- **Formula:** `res = L * voxels_per_diameter / (2 * r_mean)`
- **Example:** At r_mean=0.0045, res=252³ (within bounds [192, 320]³)
- **Safety:** Fallback to legacy method if disabled

### Testing

```bash
cd /Users/chimel/Desktop/Cursor_FoS-Custom-Grid
./venv/bin/python run.py
# Adjust FSC band to [5, 30] → particles grow → resolution should decrease
# Adjust FSC band to [15, 20] → particles shrink → resolution should increase
# Monitor: Resolution adapts dynamically in JFA telemetry
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Resolution scales with `1 / r_mean`
- [x] Resolution clamped to `[JFA_RES_MIN, JFA_RES_MAX]`
- [x] Configuration visible at startup
- [x] Toggle-able via `JFA_ADAPTIVE_ENABLED` flag
- [ ] FPS improvement of 1.3-1.5× (pending runtime testing)

## Issue 3: Fix fp64 Welford for σ(P) + Add σ(r)

**Title:** Implement numerically stable variance calculation with fp64 Welford

**Labels:** `bug`, `telemetry`, `enhancement`

**Description:**

The current pressure variance calculation (`σ(P)`) suffers from fp32 underflow when computing variance of small pressure values (r³ for small radii). This causes `σ(P)=0` even when the equilibrator is active.

### Problem

- **Current:** Two-pass naive variance, fp32 accumulators
- **Issue:** Underflows when `r³` is very small (< 1e-7)
- **Impact:** Misleading telemetry; can't tell if pressure equilibration is working

### Solution

Replace with Welford's algorithm using fp64 accumulators (✅ **Already Implemented**)

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Replaced two-pass method with Welford's single-pass algorithm in `dynamics.py`
2. ✅ Used `ti.f64` accumulators for `mean` and `m2` (sum of squared deviations)
3. ✅ Added σ(r) to telemetry in `run.py` for comparison
4. ✅ Updated docstrings with reference to Welford's algorithm

### New Telemetry Format

```
[Pressure] r_min={...} r_max={...} σ(r)={...} σ(P)={...}
```

- `σ(r)` = radius standard deviation (computed in fp64 on CPU)
- `σ(P)` = pressure standard deviation (r^P_exp, computed in fp64 on GPU)

**Diagnostic Value:**
- If `σ(r) > 0` but `σ(P) = 0` → still has underflow (shouldn't happen with Welford + fp64)
- If both are non-zero → pressure equilibration working correctly

### Testing

```bash
cd /Users/chimel/Desktop/Cursor_FoS-Custom-Grid
# Clear cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
./venv/bin/python run.py
# Wait for [EQ Debug] output every 30 frames
# Verify: σ(P) is non-zero (e.g., σ(P) ≈ 1e-8 to 1e-6)
# Verify: σ(r) and σ(P) both show variance
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Welford's algorithm implemented with fp64 accumulators
- [x] σ(P) non-zero when particles have different radii
- [x] σ(r) added to telemetry for comparison
- [x] No fp32 underflow artifacts

## Issue 4: Benchmark Harness & Performance Badge (DEFERRED)

**Title:** Add reproducible benchmark script and performance tracking

**Labels:** `tooling`, `performance`, `documentation`, `deferred`

**Status:** Deferred until Phase 2 optimization is stable. The old benchmark script was removed due to architecture mismatch (expected class-based JFA, current code is functional).

**Description:**

Create a lightweight headless benchmark that:
- Disables rendering in `run.py`
- Runs for fixed N frames
- Parses `[PERF]` log output for timing breakdown
- Computes mean FPS and per-stage averages

**Note:** Current `run.py` already emits structured `[PERF]` logs every 60 frames:
```
[PERF] Frame 180: grid=0.000s  pbd=0.047s  topo=—  render=0.006s  | FPS≈4.3
       Breakdown: grid=0%  pbd=20%  topo=77%  render=3%
```

### Implementation (TODO - Post Phase 2)

Will create `scripts/bench_headless.py` that:
1. Imports and calls `main()` from `run.py` with `RENDER=False`
2. Captures console output
3. Parses `[PERF]` lines
4. Computes aggregate statistics

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Headless benchmark script
- [ ] Parses existing `[PERF]` telemetry
- [ ] Reproducible results (fixed seed)
- [ ] JSON output for CI/CD tracking
- [ ] Document usage in README.md

## Issue 5: Spatial Decimation (Dirty Tiles) for JFA

**Title:** Implement spatial decimation for JFA using dirty tile tracking

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `performance`, `advanced`

**Description:**

**⚠️ Advanced Optimization - High-impact performance multiplier**

Only re-compute JFA in regions (tiles) where particles have moved or changed size significantly since the last JFA run. This is the most complex optimization but offers the largest potential gain: **2-6× speedup on top of existing optimizations**.

### Goal

- **Expected Gain:** 
  - Early settling: 1.5-2× (dirty 40-60%)
  - Late equilibrium: 4-8× (dirty 10-20%)
  - Combined with cadence + adaptive res: **15-30 FPS** (from current ~8 FPS)
- **Complexity:** High (tile tracking, halo regions, watchdog)

---

### 🔧 Design Choices (Production Defaults)

**1. Tile Configuration (`config.py`):**
```python
# Spatial Decimation (Dirty Tiles)
JFA_DIRTY_TILES_ENABLED = True       # Master switch for spatial decimation
JFA_TILE_SIZE = 16                   # Voxels per tile (sweet spot for cache locality)
JFA_DIRTY_HALO = 1                   # Tile halo width (use 2 during warm-start)
JFA_DIRTY_WARMSTART = True           # Disable dirty tiles during WARMSTART_FRAMES
JFA_DIRTY_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL = 30     # Force full refresh every N frames
JFA_DIRTY_ESCALATION_THRESHOLD = 0.6 # Promote to full if dirty% > 60%
```

**2. Dirty Criteria:**
- **Movement:** Mark tile dirty if `|Δpos| > 0.5 * voxel_size` or particle crosses tile boundary
- **Radius:** Mark tile dirty if `|Δr| > 0.25 * voxel_size` (power distance changes)
- **Boundary hysteresis:** Add `0.1 * voxel_size` buffer before re-marking on tile edge oscillations

**3. Halo Strategy:**
- **Default:** Expand dirty set by `+1 tile` in all 6 directions before JFA
- **Warm-start:** Use `+2 tiles` during first `WARMSTART_FRAMES`
- **Low-dirty:** If `dirty% < 25%`, consider bumping halo to 2 if artifacts appear

**4. Watchdog (Auto-escalate to Full JFA):**
- **Periodic:** Force full JFA every `JFA_DIRTY_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL` frames (default: 30)
- **High-dirty:** If `dirty% > 60%` for a frame, promote to full JFA
- **High-FSC-delta:** If `|Δμ_FSC| > 5%` vs last full refresh, promote to full JFA

**5. Integration with Existing:**
- **Cadence:** Dirty tiles work *within* existing `JFA_CADENCE=5` (only on JFA frames)
- **Adaptive res:** Dirty tiles + adaptive resolution are fully compatible
- **EMA compatibility:** FSC EMA + hysteresis buffer occasional stale regions

---

### 📊 Telemetry Format

```
[JFA] tiles={dirty}/{total} ({pct:.1f}%), halo={h}, mode={selective|full}, time={ms}
[FSC] μ={:.2f} σ={:.2f} Δμ={:.2f}% (vs last full)
```

**Optional diagnostics (every 30 frames):**
```
[Drift] mean|Δpos|={:.6f} mean|Δr|={:.6f} over N={active_n}
```

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**Correctness:**
- [ ] After each forced full refresh, `μ_FSC` within ±0.1 of selective runs
- [ ] `σ_FSC` within ±5% of selective runs
- [ ] Visual appearance indistinguishable from full-domain JFA
- [ ] No "stale seams" or artifacts at tile boundaries

**Performance:**
- [ ] When `dirty% ≤ 20-40%`, JFA time drops **2-4×** on selective frames
- [ ] Overall FPS improves **3-6×** combined with cadence + adaptive res
- [ ] Typical `dirty%` trends: 60% (early) → 40% (settling) → 10-20% (equilibrium)

**Stability:**
- [ ] Watchdog rarely promotes to full (< 5% of selective frames)
- [ ] No runaway dirtiness (stays < 60% after warm-start)
- [ ] PBC-correct tile wrapping (no edge artifacts)

---

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Tile-thrash at boundaries** | Sites oscillating on tile edges → permanent dirty | Add 0.1×voxel hysteresis before re-marking |
| **Under-marking from tiny Δr** | Thin faces flip without being caught | Use radius threshold `0.25 * voxel_size` |
| **Halo too small** | Visible seams at tile boundaries | Bump halo to 2 when `dirty% < 25%` |
| **Runaway dirtiness** | `dirty% > 60%` for > 3 cycles | Drop cadence to 2, force full refresh, re-evaluate |
| **PBC edge cases** | Particles near domain boundary cause artifacts | Wrap tile indices with same PBC logic as particles |

### 🧪 Rollout Sequence (Phased Implementation)

#### **Phase A: Instrumentation (No Selective JFA Yet)** — ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add tile grid and tracking fields to `jfa.py`
- [x] Add dirty marking kernel (movement + radius thresholds)
- [x] Print `[JFA] tiles={dirty}/{total} ({pct:.1f}%)` **without** changing JFA behavior
- [x] **Sanity check:** `dirty%` accurately reflects system state
  - **Finding:** `dirty% = 100%` consistently due to global Brownian motion + JFA cadence=5
  - **Explanation:** All 10k particles jitter continuously (Brownian motion) → all tiles legitimately dirty when JFA runs every 5 frames
  - **Validation:** Instrumentation working correctly (marking, clearing, cache update all verified)
  - **Conclusion:** Dirty tiles won't provide speedup for globally-active systems with Brownian motion, but instrumentation is sound for future use cases with localized changes

#### **Phase B: Selective JFA (Enable with Watchdog)**
- [ ] Modify `rasterize_seeds` to only write in dirty tiles
- [ ] Modify `jfa_pass` to skip clean tiles
- [ ] Modify `collect_faces` to only scan dirty tiles
- [ ] Implement halo expansion (+1 tile in all directions)
- [ ] Implement watchdog (full refresh every 30 frames)
- [ ] **Validation:** FSC distribution matches full-domain runs (±5%)

#### **Phase C: Tune & Optimize**
- [ ] Adjust thresholds to keep `dirty%` typically 10-40%
- [ ] Tune halo width based on observed artifacts
- [ ] Add boundary hysteresis if tile-thrash detected
- [ ] Implement escalation logic (high-dirty → full JFA)
- [ ] **Performance:** Measure JFA time reduction vs dirty%

### 📈 Expected Outcomes (10k Particles, 192³ JFA Grid)

| Scenario | Dirty % | JFA Time | Overall FPS | Speedup |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Startup (warm-start)** | 100% | ~170ms | ~8 FPS | 1.0× (baseline) |
| **Early settling** | 40-60% | ~70-100ms | ~13-19 FPS | **1.6-2.4×** |
| **Late equilibrium** | 10-20% | ~20-40ms | ~25-40 FPS | **3.1-5.0×** |

**Combined with existing optimizations:**
- Multi-rate cadence (5 frames): 2.4×
- Adaptive resolution: 1.3× (geometric mean)
- Dirty tiles: 3-5× (on selective frames)
- **Total:** ~10-12× from baseline (~4 FPS → ~40-50 FPS)

---

### 🗺️ Future Multipliers (Post-Phase C)

1. **Adaptive cadence by dirtiness:** If `dirty% < 10%`, skip JFA entirely (effective cadence → 10-12)
2. **Incremental passes:** Only run late JFA passes in tiles whose labels changed after early passes
3. **Seed raster pooling:** Cache seed IDs per tile; reuse when unchanged (reduces memory traffic)

---
